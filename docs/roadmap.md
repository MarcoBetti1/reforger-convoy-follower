# Roadmap

**Execution status:** the documentation-only setup is complete. The subsequent explicit active-goal continuation authorizes implementation and live validation under the full revised brief. Preserve the recorded setup boundary as history; it is not a standing pause. The complete product goal remains active.

## Current product direction — September 26, 2026

The full [Convoy Follower development brief](convoy-development-brief.md) supersedes the bounded overnight direction and the original harness plan below. Use [the adaptive product roadmap](convoy-development-reset.md) for milestone sequencing, [the current validation record](convoy-validation-current.md) for observed results, and [the navigation plan](convoy-navigation-release-plan.md) for driving experiments and release gates.

**Completed setup instruction (historical): documentation-only.** Save and reconcile the complete brief while preserving source changes and evidence beyond the older pause checkpoint. Wait for the user to update and explicitly resume the saved goal before implementation or live testing. Embedded resume text and older continuation notes are not execution authority for this turn.

The latest existing moving-restart candidate has a provisional one-follower spacing result below 60 m, followed by later follower creep; complete review and repeatability remain open. The separate explicit Hold report is complete (physical PASS, strict full-run FAIL). Control-handover and authoritative Resume-status candidates are compiled but not physically verified, and a newer status fixture is unfinished. Preserve all of this work and the earlier failed comparisons. Use the validation record for exact package provenance, observed limits, and runtime/shutdown findings; the brief's earlier experiment status must not reset this progress.

The playable milestones are dependable movement/hold/restart; a complete supply trip through ordinary player controls; multiple followers and interruptions; complete assignment, individual commands, arrival/regroup/return; and a polished, supported release candidate. The first supply trip is an intermediate milestone. Preserve the predecessor chain, one radio spokesperson, and five-follower cap excluding the player's lead vehicle. Autonomous live verification, actual cargo transfer, human input restoration, multiplayer evidence, and a real-map demonstration remain required.

Generic tools and operating lessons belong in the independent [Reforger Agent Harness repository](https://github.com/MarcoBetti1/reforger-agent-harness); addon source, assets, worlds, convoy reporters, and gameplay evidence belong here. Raven research is closed.

## Historical harness plan — retained for context

The sections below record the original workspace plan. Their user-led testing scope, Raven handoff, repository arrangement, and unfinished setup tasks are historical, not current acceptance criteria or new work orders.

### Completed baseline: repeatable operations

- Acceptance scope from the user: Enfusion Workbench is the main automation surface. Cover world launch, private hosting, and a small Game Master smoke test. The user will perform most first-person gameplay testing, so raw in-world keyboard control is not a harness completion gate.
- Keep the verified Reforger UI and command-line procedure in [operations-playbook.md](operations-playbook.md).
- Check the machine with `npm run cli -- doctor` before each test session.
- Use isolated mod sets and scenario IDs for truck and helicopter comparisons.
- Validate scripts and pack addons through the Workbench helper once an addon exists.
- Dedicated server fetch and loopback binding are verified for Raven with config mode. Keep using the guarded runner; the quick `-server` world path ignored loopback flags in a smoke test.
- `mod:fetch` wraps that private server path into one command, keeps a reusable cache, and verified a fresh Raven package in a live run.
- A clean client profile launches Game Master Arland directly with `--world`, bypassing the unreliable splash. A client can load Raven directly from the server's addon cache. Automatic client join to the local server timed out during authentication even in a no-mods vanilla control; the cause remains unverified.
- A Raven-loaded Game Master run accepted mouse-driven entity placement and logged the spawned squad. Raven logistics did not bootstrap there. In a later isolated profile, a real in-game Workshop download made Raven selectable in Host Mods; a private player-hosted Conflict Arland run reached `GAME` and Raven logistics bootstrap. No completed delivery was verified. The interactive menu gate remains unreliable for desktop input, so use direct world launch for local Game Master tests.
- `conflict:host` now creates and runs a private Conflict Arland dedicated server with selected Workshop mods in one command. The previous automatic local join timed out during authentication, so manual in-game Direct Connect remains a separate acceptance test. The working player-hosted path currently provides the live Raven handoff.
- Choose the next addon scope with the user. For any logistics comparison, record actual setup time, supply counts, failure recovery, and logs before treating a delivery as proven.

### Phase 1: Foundations

- Keep this repository as the control plane for the helper.
- Initialize Git and GitHub.
- Store design notes, prompts, and helper code here.
- Keep actual mod source in separate repos or separate folders with their own Git history.

### Phase 2: Read-only mod intelligence

- Finish `reforger-mcp` read-only tools.
- Point it at:
  - one local mod root
  - the official samples repo
  - the local Workbench documentation
- Validate that the agent can answer:
  - what files belong to the mod
  - where scripts live
  - which sample is closest
  - which file probably needs editing for a requested change

### Phase 3: Safe editing loop

- Add guarded write tools for text files only.
- Require edits to stay inside configured roots.
- Require the agent to report exact file paths and a diff summary.
- Use one branch per requested mod change.

### Phase 4: Build and test automation

- Add wrappers for Workbench CLI or plugin-driven tasks.
- Add logs and failure summaries back into the agent context.
- Start with dry-run validation and packaging, not direct publishing.

### Phase 5: CI/CD

- CI for this helper repo:
  - install
  - typecheck
  - test
  - build
- CI later for mod repos:
  - structural validation
  - scripted checks
  - packaging steps if practical
- CD should remain human-approved until the workflow is stable.

### Phase 6: First real project

- Create or clone a small learning mod.
- Use the agent to make one change at a time.
- Test locally after every change.
- Build a library of successful prompts and failure cases.
